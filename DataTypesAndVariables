 Strings: 'hello world' or "hello world"
          "Peter O'Toole" or 'Peter O\'Toole'
          (escape character is the backslash (\) and tells the inrerpreter
          to use alternate meaning for the following character
          See page 19 for a table for more useful ones

  Boolean Data: True or False
                easy way to determine 'yes' or 'no'

  Variables:
            Data can be stored permanently or temporarily
            permanent should go to a database or a file
            temporary should be stored in a variable- much quicker

            each variable needs a name so you can access the data
                case sensitive
                cannot be a reserved word like var or width
                certain characters are not allowed: % or &
                allowed to contain numbers, but cannot start with numbers
             declare variables:
                use the var keyword: var myvariable;
             assign value: myVariable= 'name';
             *notice the absence of the var keyword-- only use once.*
